### Lab Tasks
- **`Task 1: Resolution & Histogram` Take grayscale image of size 512x512 & perform the following operations -**
	- **(a) Decrease its spatial resolution by half every time and observe its change when displaying in the same window size**
	- **(b) Decrease its intensity level resolution by one bit up to reach its binary format & observe its change when displaying in the same window size**
	- **(c) Illustrate the histogram of the image and make single threshold segmentation observed from the histogram** 
- **`Task 2: Point Processing` Take a grayscale image of size 512x512 and perform the following operations –**
	- **(a) Perform the brightness enhancement of a specific range of gray levels & observe its result**
	- **(b) Differentiate the results of power law inverse logarithmic transformation**
	- **(c) Find the difference image between original & the image obtained by last three bits (MSB)**
- **`Task 3: Spatial Filtering` Take a grayscale image of size 512x512, add some salt & pepper noise & perform the following operations –**
	- **(a) Apply average and median spatial filters with 5x5 mask & observe their performance for noise suppression in term of PSNR**
	- **(b) Use different size of mask (3x3, 5x5, 7x7) with average filter for noise suppression & observe their performance in term of PSNR**
	- **(c) Apply harmonic & geometric mean filter on the noisy image & compare their performance with PSNR**
- **`Task 4: Frequency Domain Filtering` Take a grayscale image of size 512x512, add some Gaussian noise & perform the following operations in the frequency domain –**
	- **(a) Apply 4th order Butterworth & Gaussian low pass filter to analyze their performance quantitatively**
	- **(b) Observe the ringing effect of the ideal low pass filter on the image. Use different radius of ideal low-pass filters & display their results**
	- **(c) Perform edge detection of given the noisy & clean image using ideal & Gaussian high pass filters**
 - **`Task 5: Morphological Operation` Take a binary image & perform the following morphological operations –**
	- **(a) Perform Erosion & Dilation operations**
	- **(b) Opening & Closing operations**
	- **(c) Boundary extraction using morphological operation**
